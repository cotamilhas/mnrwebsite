# ModNation Website OLD
Brand New ModNation Racers Website!!!
## Goals I would like to achieve (if possible):

 - Connect to the Private Server, see players profile and their creations, etc...;
 
 - Adding some more customization;
 
 - Adding some feature that were present in the Original Website (Like Custom Signatures and Download Avatars);
 
 - ~Maybe a Discord Iframe from ModNation Racers Discord Server;~
 
 - ~Support Modnation Racers: Mini-GP (Maybe a Downloadable link);~
 
 - A mobile interface (I don't have any idea how I can do that :D)
